# 4.043 Design Studio: Advanced Interactions

This course is an overview of core principles and methodologies for the design of interaction and behavior across objects and spaces. Instruction follows the path from prototype to a deployable interactive experience, through lectures, hands-on workshops, and studio assignments. Students will gain an understanding of the overall interaction design process, with an emphasis on experience prototyping, testing, and iteration, preparing them for work in a professional environment. Topics include the history and principles of human-computer interaction; techniques for rapid behavior prototyping; user experience and testing; haptics and feedback; internet of things; and programmable materials.

This course provides a foundation in behavior prototyping and technical skills, such as modeling, digital fabrication, electronics, coding, and interaction design. Lectures will provide a technical foundation to enable students to create their own work, as well as a historical and contextual background for the critique and evaluation of interaction design. In particular, this semester we will be collaborating with ECAL (www.ecal.ch) and creating interfaces that can connect students across the USA and Switzerland. Lectures from interaction designers and industry experts will help expand and contextualize the topics covered in the course.

## Project 1: 1D Interface

We will start the course by creating a 1D game and a custom joystick for controlling it. Students will learn techniques for in-hardware sketching and prototyping, creating state diagrams, building their own electronics, designing a graphical user interface, coding, as well as techniques for evaluating and critiquing interaction and interface design.

## Project 2: IRL

The global pandemic has forever changed how we work, learn and play, making virtual communication the primary form of human interaction. In Project 2, we will design physical interfaces that allow for remote communication and collaboration, allowing students to extend their virtual reach into each other's physical spaces. We will extend and augment video chatting with networked objects and explore notions of remote presence, simultaneous actions, shared experience and telepresence. We will collaborate with ECAL in Lausanne, Switzerland to develop and test our interfaces.
